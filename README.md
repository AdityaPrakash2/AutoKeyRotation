# AutoKeyRotation
This project implements automated key rotation for JSON Web Token (JWT) signing in Keycloak, using HashiCorp Vault as a secure secret store. By leveraging Vault’s ability to generate and manage cryptographic keys, this setup enhances security by ensuring that Keycloak’s signing keys are rotated on a defined schedule without manual intervention.
