# Roadmap for Keycloak-Vault Integration

## Current Status (Completed)
- [x] **Vault Setup**: Successfully set up HashiCorp Vault instance with proper configuration
- [x] **Automated Key Rotation**: Implemented scripts for rotating RSA keys with history preservation
- [x] **Docker Compose Environment**: Created a functional development environment with all necessary services
- [x] **Basic Integration**: Set up environment variables for Keycloak to access Vault
- [x] **Key Monitoring**: Implemented scripts to display and monitor active keys
- [x] **Keycloak Notification**: Added automatic notification to Keycloak when keys are rotated

## Phase 1: Keycloak SPI Implementation
- [ ] **Study Keycloak SPI Architecture**: Complete extensive review of Keycloak's Service Provider Interface, particularly for key providers
- [ ] **Set Up Development Environment**: 
  - [ ] Set up a proper Maven or Gradle project for building the SPI
  - [ ] Include all necessary Keycloak dependencies
- [ ] **Create Basic KeyProvider Implementation**: 
  - [ ] Implement VaultKeyProvider to fetch keys from Vault
  - [ ] Manage key lifecycle (storing, retrieving, rotating)
- [ ] **Create KeyProviderFactory Implementation**: 
  - [ ] Develop the factory class to create instances of VaultKeyProvider
  - [ ] Implement configuration handling for the provider
- [ ] **Test Initial SPI**: 
  - [ ] Unit tests for the implementation
  - [ ] Integration tests with Vault in a controlled environment

## Phase 2: Advanced Features
- [ ] **Caching and Performance**: 
  - [ ] Implement caching strategy for keys to reduce Vault API calls
  - [ ] Optimize key retrieval and rotation operations
- [ ] **Security Improvements**: 
  - [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging
  - [ ] Add security measures against potential attacks
  - [ ] Support Vault's authentication methods beyond token
- [ ] **Key Lifecycle Management**: 
  - [ ] Implement support for key expiration
  - [ ] Add support for multiple key algorithms
  - [ ] Support key recovery mechanisms

## Phase 3: Integration and Deployment
- [ ] **Deployment Guide**: 
  - [ ] Create comprehensive documentation for deploying in production
  - [ ] Include security best practices
- [ ] **Monitoring and Alerting**: 
  - [ ] Add monitoring endpoints
  - [ ] Create alert configurations for key rotation failures
- [ ] **Testing and Documentation**: 
  - [ ] End-to-end testing across different environments
  - [ ] Create detailed documentation for users and administrators

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Focus on fixing compilation issues with the SPI implementation
2. Complete the VaultKeyProvider class implementation
3. Test the SPI with the Keycloak container using volumes to inject the compiled JAR
4. Document the working implementation in the README.md

## Development Tips
- When working on the SPI, refer to Keycloak's documentation and existing SPIs for guidance
- Use proper logging to debug issues during development
- Consider using a dedicated development container for compiling and testing the SPI
- Ensure proper error handling in both the SPI and key rotation scripts
