# Roadmap for Keycloak-Vault Integration

## Current Status (Completed)
- [x] **Vault Setup**: Successfully set up HashiCorp Vault instance with proper configuration
- [x] **Automated Client Secret Rotation**: Implemented scripts for rotating client secrets with history preservation
- [x] **Docker Compose Environment**: Created a functional development environment with all necessary services
- [x] **Basic Integration**: Set up environment variables for Keycloak to access Vault
- [x] **Client Secret Monitoring**: Implemented scripts to display and monitor active client secrets
- [x] **Client Authentication Testing**: Added automatic testing of client authentication after rotation
- [x] **Direct Vault Integration**: Implemented direct Vault integration for client secret validation
- [x] **Automated Startup Process**: Created automated initialization scripts that run on container startup
- [x] **Cron-based Rotation**: Implemented scheduled rotation of client secrets using cron
- [x] **Streamlined Codebase**: Organized and simplified codebase for better maintainability

## Phase 1: Enhanced Vault Integration (Completed)
- [x] **Basic Client Secret Validation via Vault**: Successfully implemented validation of client credentials against Vault
- [x] **Client Attributes for Vault Integration**: Added client attributes to control Vault integration
- [x] **Script-based Integration**: Created scripts to set up and manage the Vault integration
- [ ] **Keycloak Event Listeners**: Add event listeners to log client authentication events with Vault
- [ ] **Secret Transition Period**: Implement support for a transition period where old and new secrets are both valid

## Phase 2: Advanced Integration
- [ ] **Custom Authentication Flow**: Create a custom authentication flow for clients that directly queries Vault
- [ ] **Vault Policy Refinement**: Implement more granular Vault policies for different client types
- [ ] **Secret Rotation Scheduling**: Add support for scheduled rotations with different intervals per client
- [ ] **Rotation Automation API**: Create a REST API for triggering rotations programmatically
- [ ] **Secret Recovery Mechanisms**: Implement mechanisms to recover from failed rotations
- [ ] **Monitoring and Alerting**: Add monitoring for rotation failures and authentication failures

## Phase 3: Security Enhancements
- [ ] **Vault AppRole Authentication**: Replace token-based authentication with AppRole
- [ ] **Secure Bootstrapping**: Improve the secure bootstrapping of Vault tokens
- [ ] **Secret Encryption**: Add additional encryption layers for secrets
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive audit logging for all secret operations
- [ ] **Zero Trust Security Model**: Enhance the architecture to follow zero trust principles

## Phase 4: Production Readiness
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Optimize Vault interaction performance and caching
- [ ] **High Availability**: Ensure all components support high availability configurations
- [ ] **Kubernetes Deployment**: Create Kubernetes manifests for deployment
- [ ] **Comprehensive Testing**: Add end-to-end testing across different environments
- [ ] **Production Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for production deployment

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Implement error notification for failed rotations
2. Add more comprehensive logging for all operations
3. Enhance security with Vault AppRole authentication instead of root token
4. Create a custom authentication flow for direct Vault integration

## Development Tips
- Consider implementing a caching layer to reduce Vault API calls
- Explore Vault's response wrapping feature for secure secret delivery
- Ensure proper error handling and logging in both scripts and Keycloak integration
- Add metrics collection for monitoring secret rotation health
