# Roadmap for Keycloak-Vault Integration

## Current Status (Completed)
- [x] **Vault Setup**: Successfully set up HashiCorp Vault instance with proper configuration
- [x] **Automated Client Secret Rotation**: Implemented scripts for rotating client secrets with history preservation
- [x] **Docker Compose Environment**: Created a functional development environment with all necessary services
- [x] **Basic Integration**: Set up environment variables for Keycloak to access Vault
- [x] **Client Secret Monitoring**: Implemented scripts to display and monitor active client secrets
- [x] **Client Authentication Testing**: Added automatic testing of client authentication after rotation
- [x] **Direct Vault Integration**: Implemented direct Vault integration for client secret validation
- [x] **Automated Startup Process**: Created automated initialization scripts that run on container startup
- [x] **Cron-based Rotation**: Implemented scheduled rotation of client secrets using cron
- [x] **Streamlined Codebase**: Organized and simplified codebase for better maintainability
- [x] **Demo Application**: Created a Flask web application that demonstrates the integration
- [x] **Session Management**: Implemented proper session handling and cleanup
- [x] **Consolidated Docker Composition**: Combined multiple Docker Compose files into a unified environment
- [x] **Enhanced User Interface**: Improved the demo application UI with conditional elements based on login state
- [x] **Enhanced Startup Script**: Created a comprehensive startup script with multiple commands for managing the environment

## Phase 1: Enhanced Vault Integration (Mostly Completed)
- [x] **Basic Client Secret Validation via Vault**: Successfully implemented validation of client credentials against Vault
- [x] **Client Attributes for Vault Integration**: Added client attributes to control Vault integration
- [x] **Script-based Integration**: Created scripts to set up and manage the Vault integration
- [x] **Internal/External URL Handling**: Implemented separate URL handling for internal vs. browser-facing connections
- [x] **JWT Token Parsing**: Added ability to extract user information from JWT access tokens
- [ ] **Keycloak Event Listeners**: Add event listeners to log client authentication events with Vault
- [ ] **Secret Transition Period**: Implement support for a transition period where old and new secrets are both valid

## Phase 2: Advanced Integration
- [ ] **Custom Authentication Flow**: Create a custom authentication flow for clients that directly queries Vault
- [ ] **Vault Policy Refinement**: Implement more granular Vault policies for different client types
- [ ] **Secret Rotation Scheduling**: Add support for scheduled rotations with different intervals per client
- [ ] **Rotation Automation API**: Create a REST API for triggering rotations programmatically
- [ ] **Secret Recovery Mechanisms**: Implement mechanisms to recover from failed rotations
- [ ] **Monitoring and Alerting**: Add monitoring for rotation failures and authentication failures

## Phase 3: Security Enhancements
- [ ] **Vault AppRole Authentication**: Replace token-based authentication with AppRole
- [ ] **Secure Bootstrapping**: Improve the secure bootstrapping of Vault tokens
- [ ] **Secret Encryption**: Add additional encryption layers for secrets
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive audit logging for all secret operations
- [ ] **Zero Trust Security Model**: Enhance the architecture to follow zero trust principles

## Phase 4: Production Readiness
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Optimize Vault interaction performance and caching
- [ ] **High Availability**: Ensure all components support high availability configurations
- [ ] **Kubernetes Deployment**: Create Kubernetes manifests for deployment
- [ ] **Comprehensive Testing**: Add end-to-end testing across different environments
- [ ] **Production Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for production deployment

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Implement Keycloak event listeners for more granular audit logging
2. Add support for a secret transition period
3. Enhance security with Vault AppRole authentication instead of root token
4. Create a custom authentication flow for direct Vault integration

## Areas for Improvement
- Implement caching for Vault responses to improve performance
- Add monitoring and alerting for failed rotations
- Create more comprehensive logging and metrics collection
- Add support for additional Keycloak client types beyond confidential clients
- Implement integration with external monitoring systems

## Development Tips
- Consider implementing a caching layer to reduce Vault API calls
- Explore Vault's response wrapping feature for secure secret delivery
- Ensure proper error handling and logging in both scripts and Keycloak integration
- Add metrics collection for monitoring secret rotation health
